The most common instruments used are metallophones played by mallets and a set of hand-played drums called kendhang/Kendang, which register the beat. The kemanak (a banana-shaped idiophone) and gangsa (another metallophone) are commonly used gamelan instruments in Bali. Other instruments include xylophones, bamboo flutes, a bowed instrument called a rebab, a zither-like instrument siter (in Javanese ensemble) and vocalists named sindhen (female) or gerong (male).`,

      description: `"La Llorona" (lit. "The weeping woman") is a Mexican folk song derived from the legend of La Llorona. There are many versions of the song. Its origins are obscure, but, around 1941, composer Andres Henestrosa mentioned hearing the song in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. He popularized the song and may have added to the existing verses \n The La Llorona of the song drowned her children in a river in a rage at her unfaithful husband. As a spirit, she was condemned to wander the shores of the river forever searching for her dead children. In Latin America the song is associated with the Day of the Dead \n The late Chavela Vargas is known throughout the Americas for her songs of struggle, defiance, and triumph. When Vargas recorded the song back in the 1990s, she remained loyal to the ranchera genre by making the guitar the primary instrument in the song. Although Vargas did remain true to the typical ranchera sound, she also created her own unique sound in the process. Carlos Gutierrez of Cinema Tropical explains "she took ranchero music and made the music her own. She stripped the music from the trumpet and other arrangements."`,

It is one of the oldest instruments to date. It consists of a long tube, without finger holes, through which the player blows. It is sometimes fitted with a mouthpiece of beeswax. Didgeridoos are traditionally made of eucalyptus, but contemporary materials such as PVC piping are used. In traditional situations it is played only by men, usually as an accompaniment to ceremonial or recreational singing, or, much more rarely, as a solo instrument. Skilled players use the technique of circular breathing to achieve a continuous sound, and also employ techniques for inducing multiple harmonic resonances. Although traditionally the instrument was not widespread around the country - it was only used by Aboriginal groups in the most northerly areas - today it is commonly considered the national instrument of Aboriginal Australians and is world-renowned as a unique and iconic instrument.`,

Jorge Cafrune initially popularized the song, which quickly gained popularity both in Argentina and around the world ... This song is recognized as one of the most beloved piece of Argentine folk music, and it ranks among the thirteen most popular songs in Argentina.\nAlthough the song's lyrics don't have any political or social context, it was prohibited by the military dictatorship that took power in Argentina in 1976. In 1978, Jorge Cafrune and several others performed the song, defying the ban at the public's behest during the Cosquín Festival. He publicly declared, "Even if it is not on the authorized list, if my people request it, I will sing it". Sadly, a few days later, he was killed in a hit-and-run incident involving a Rastrojero van. There have been grave suspicions that this might have been an assassination arranged by the military regime.`,

The refrain of the schlager song goes: "In München steht ein Hofbräushaus - oans, zwoa, g'suffa", Bavarian dialect German for "There's a Hofbräuhaus in Munich - one, two, let's drink!".\nThe song was composed by Wilhelm "Wiga" Gabriel from Berlin (1897 - 1964). According to legend, Gabriel found the melody to the text written by his friend Klaus Siegfried from Bad Hindelang in the Café am Zoo in Berlin. As the composer did not have any paper at hand, he wrote the notes on the title page of the Berliner Illustrierten newspaper. The start of the melody resembles the Munich city hymn Solang der alte Peter. Gabriel is said to have resorted to this folk song for the melody. The Hofbräuhaus song, musically a waltz, was first performed at the Wurstmarkt in Bad Dürkheim in 1936. It developed to a carnival melody at the carnival time in the next year and found its way to the Hofbräuhaus, where Gabriel conducted it himself and was rewarded with a giant mug of beer.`,

Music in Madagascar tends toward major keys and diatonic scales, although coastal music makes frequent use of minor keys, most likely due to early Arab influences at coastal ports of call.

The performer imitates sounds of nature, simultaneously emitting two distinct vocal sounds: along with a continuous drone, the singer produces a melody of harmonics. Khöömei literally means pharynx, and it is believed to have been learned from birds, whose spirits are central to shamanic practices. The multitude of Khöömei techniques in Mongolia are grouped within two main styles: the kharkhiraa (deep Khöömei) and isgeree Khöömei (whistled Khöömei). In kharkhiraa the singer sings a drone in a normal voice, while emphasizing the undertone or subharmonic one octave below. In isgeree Khöömei, it is the overtones above the fundamental note of the drone that are emphasized, creating a higher-pitched whistle. In both cases, the drone is produced with very taut vocal cords, and the melody is created by modulating the size and shape of the mouth cavity, opening and closing the lips and moving the tongue. Khöömei is performed by Mongolian nomads in a variety of social occasions, from grand state ceremonies to festive household events. Khöömei is also sung during herding, and inside the yurt to lull babies to sleep. Traditionally, Khöömei is transmitted orally from bearer to learner, or via master-to-apprentice.`,

In his review of the record, Nigerian musicologist Aken Euba wrote that these tracks “provide a good cross-section of the music of five African ethnic groups and is, from this point of view, useful for the general student of African Culture.” Liner notes include ethnographic profiles of the five groups, a map of their geographical distribution, a diagram of their linguistic classification, photographs, and annotations of each track which include partial translations.`,

Traditionally, when these groups reunited at the start of the long, dark winter, they exchanged songs. Each person is believed to be a composer and performer; each song is a gift to be reciprocated, and the sharing of songs and dances was a way to strengthen the social fabric. Many songs on this album are about hunting, but it was forbidden to exchange songs whilehunting, or even while outdoors. The Inuit believed that under an open sky, “a spirit could steal the words and by seizing the breath of the singer, rob him of his life.”`,
