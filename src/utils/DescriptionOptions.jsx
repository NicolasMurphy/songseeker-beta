The most common instruments used are metallophones played by mallets and a set of hand-played drums called kendhang/Kendang, which register the beat. The kemanak (a banana-shaped idiophone) and gangsa (another metallophone) are commonly used gamelan instruments in Bali. Other instruments include xylophones, bamboo flutes, a bowed instrument called a rebab, a zither-like instrument siter (in Javanese ensemble) and vocalists named sindhen (female) or gerong (male).`,

      description: `"La Llorona" (lit. "The weeping woman") is a Mexican folk song derived from the legend of La Llorona. There are many versions of the song. Its origins are obscure, but, around 1941, composer Andres Henestrosa mentioned hearing the song in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. He popularized the song and may have added to the existing verses \n The La Llorona of the song drowned her children in a river in a rage at her unfaithful husband. As a spirit, she was condemned to wander the shores of the river forever searching for her dead children. In Latin America the song is associated with the Day of the Dead \n The late Chavela Vargas is known throughout the Americas for her songs of struggle, defiance, and triumph. When Vargas recorded the song back in the 1990s, she remained loyal to the ranchera genre by making the guitar the primary instrument in the song. Although Vargas did remain true to the typical ranchera sound, she also created her own unique sound in the process. Carlos Gutierrez of Cinema Tropical explains "she took ranchero music and made the music her own. She stripped the music from the trumpet and other arrangements."`,

      description: "A didgeridoo is a type of musical instrument that, according to western musicological classification, falls into the category of aerophone. It is one of the oldest instruments to date. It consists of a long tube, without finger holes, through which the player blows. It is sometimes fitted with a mouthpiece of beeswax. Didgeridoos are traditionally made of eucalyptus, but contemporary materials such as PVC piping are used. In traditional situations it is played only by men, usually as an accompaniment to ceremonial or recreational singing, or, much more rarely, as a solo instrument. Skilled players use the technique of circular breathing to achieve a continuous sound, and also employ techniques for inducing multiple harmonic resonances. Although traditionally the instrument was not widespread around the country - it was only used by Aboriginal groups in the most northerly areas - today it is commonly considered the national instrument of Aboriginal Australians and is world-renowned as a unique and iconic instrument.",

The song was written by Luis Profili from Mendoza, back in the 1950s, but it was formally registered under the pseudonym Luis H. Morales in 1964. Jorge Cafrune initially popularized the song, which quickly gained popularity both in Argentina and around the world ... This song is recognized as one of the most beloved piece of Argentine folk music, and it ranks among the thirteen most popular songs in Argentina.\nAlthough the song's lyrics don't have any political or social context, it was prohibited by the military dictatorship that took power in Argentina in 1976. In 1978, Jorge Cafrune and several others performed the song, defying the ban at the public's behest during the Cosquín Festival. He publicly declared, "Even if it is not on the authorized list, if my people request it, I will sing it". Sadly, a few days later, he was killed in a hit-and-run incident involving a Rastrojero van. There have been grave suspicions that this might have been an assassination arranged by the military regime.`,

The refrain of the schlager song goes: "In München steht ein Hofbräushaus - oans, zwoa, g'suffa", Bavarian dialect German for "There's a Hofbräuhaus in Munich - one, two, let's drink!".\nThe song was composed by Wilhelm "Wiga" Gabriel from Berlin (1897 - 1964). According to legend, Gabriel found the melody to the text written by his friend Klaus Siegfried from Bad Hindelang in the Café am Zoo in Berlin. As the composer did not have any paper at hand, he wrote the notes on the title page of the Berliner Illustrierten newspaper. The start of the melody resembles the Munich city hymn Solang der alte Peter. Gabriel is said to have resorted to this folk song for the melody. The Hofbräuhaus song, musically a waltz, was first performed at the Wurstmarkt in Bad Dürkheim in 1936. It developed to a carnival melody at the carnival time in the next year and found its way to the Hofbräuhaus, where Gabriel conducted it himself and was rewarded with a giant mug of beer.`,

A common vocal style among the Merina and Betsileo of the Highlands, for instance, does not preclude differences in the prevalence of particular instrument types (the valiha among the Merina, and the marovany and kabosy among the Betsileo). Similarly, the practice of tromba (entering a trance state, typically induced by music) is present on both the western and eastern coasts of the island but the vocal styles or instruments used in the ceremony will vary regionally. Music in Madagascar tends toward major keys and diatonic scales, although coastal music makes frequent use of minor keys, most likely due to early Arab influences at coastal ports of call. Malagasy music has served a wide range of social, spiritual and mundane functions across the centuries.",
